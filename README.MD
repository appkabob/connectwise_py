# Purpose

Use this library to pull data from your Connectwise Manage instance via the Connectwise Manage API.

You can use it in combination with libraries like [reportlab](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/reportlab) to automatically generate custom reports, or use it to schedule custom emails to go out based on specific event in CW.

This Python library can help bridge the gap between Connectwise and your other systems.
